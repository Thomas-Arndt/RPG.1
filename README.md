This will eventually become a rad first attempt at a 2d action rpg. I am using Godot Engine to create it.
The current idea is to create a world where travel and trade between neighboring dimensions is practical, and some select few people are even able to do it without the need of sophisticated technology.
Gameplay will include mechanics such as:
shifting between the two dimensions: the Green Path, and the Red Dimension
you can only see monsters in the dimension you currently are in, but the monters have somehow become capable of harming you regardless of dimension.
The landscape will liely be different between the two dimenions, forcing the player to shift between dimensions to get past obstacles
