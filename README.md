This will eventually become a rad first attempt at a 2d action rpg. I am using Godot Engine to create it.
The current idea is that the main character is from a parallel dimension but has somehow ended up in one of the two game-accessible dimensions. Through the story, the player will rid the local dimensions of nasty monsters that are preventing any efforts to seal a breach in the volume of the multiverse. Their efforts will culminate in repairing the multiversal volume which returns the local verses to a state of "normalcy" (though their inhabitants may be forever changed, hopefully for the better). The player will need to traverse from one verse to a parallel one via an "In Between" non-versal area. There will be monsters that can inhabit both verses, others cannot. Some objects will be present in one verse and not the other. Some characters will be in both verses (though different in some small or big way), some may be only in one verse.
